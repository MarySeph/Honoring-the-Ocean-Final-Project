> Figure1 & 2. Tadashi as a young teen.

Name: (insert kanji) -  Hikage Tadatsugu
Nickname: Tadashi (self-imposed)

Pronouns: he/him
Zodiac: Virgo
Birthday: September 18th

## Physical Description

### Face
Sunset eyes and wavy asparagus green hair are his most noticeable features, rather average in the sea of well-groomed and composed boy and girls at his school. A thin braid falls behind his right ear, clamped with a ring. He is young looking, wearing minimal makeup and trimmed brows. A beauty mark under his left eye adorns his cheek. Tadashi holds his signature radiant smile with pride.

### Body
He has languid limbs, a family trait. Because he is slimmer than average, he has a hard time finding clothes. He is 163 cm tall and underweight. He has a complex about his body because he isn't as strong or well-built as other popular boys. His posture is straight but tense, only relaxed at home. His skin is pale with a yellow undertone.

## Personality

**Introvert/Extrovert:** Introvert.

Tadashi is the prince-like persona he created in his first year at middle school. He's sensible, picking up the slightest change in others' mood. He supports whoever asks for his help and is particularly gentle towards girls. On the other hand, he can't stand criticism and is paranoid about maintaining his social status. Selfless to a fault,  Tadashi is a pushover.

Tadatsugu is quite the opposite. He is ambitious, independent, and perseverant in everything he wants to achieve, trying to conquer one of his many childhood fears every day. Like Tadashi, he is prone to paranoia which branched off a persecution complex because of a classmate he now despises. He is quick to hate and slow to forgive, even more slow to forget. In front of his sister, he is whiny without reservations, full of himself, and bratty. He is emotionally immature and stubborn about maintaining and nurturing the negative image he has of his parents.

### Strengths/Weaknesses
His high EQ. Humility.

When he forces on his prince persona, he becomes more self-focused and takes care his choice of words match that persona. He becomes less empathetic but instead he is more sociable and can keep longer conversations. He believes this persona is much more interesting than his usual, boring self. Jealousy and hatred easily blinds him, leading to hurt people's feelings which he usually takes great care of. This care makes him easy to get walked on by smarter or charismatic people. He will instantly break down if his lies and facades are seen through.

### Fatal Flaw(s)

### Goals/Dreams/Aspirations

### Fears
He is terrified of losing his place in the social ladder, going as far as falling in line and be part of herd thinking. He can be part of class bullying, although his role isn't physical like most boys.

### Insecurities
He is deeply insecure of his body, blaming his family genes for being lanky. He detests his long fingers and his weak limbs.

### Other Notable Personality Features

#### Enemies
He despises his classmate, [[Ryuugamine Kiyoshi]]. When they were first years and Tadashi was starting out with his new persona, he wanted to get acquaintance with the Western pretty boy with the hope of being friends. The blonde boy kept to himself and Tadashi couldn't help but project his weak personality on him, believing the boy truly wanted to connect with his peers but wasn't very confident. The more he learned about the boy in their short exchanges, the more he was convinced Ryuugamine was like him. However, the day of the school festival Kiyoshi rejected him harshly and Tadashi reluctantly stepped down, offended. In the following months, he and his peers noticed the boy was staring at them and were grossed out. Tadashi began to think Ryuugamine knew he was being fake and was judging him from a distance. His paranoia only grew and with it, one-sided hatred became a protection from the pain from rejection and self-deception. There are times when the feeling is unbearable, and as he learned on his first middle school festival, passive-aggressively bitching about him on social media calms him down. The posts are inconspicious and he never revealed any information about the boy.
  
## Backstory
He was born into a somewhat wealthy family. His father is a college professor and his mother a psychologist. His older sister is a Teikoku highschool graduate on her second year of college, College of Arts and Sciences.

His efforts to get praise as a child were futile as his parents weren't impressive because it was nothing compared to his sister's. Even though he doesn't dislike her personally as she is the only support he has for his career as a model he easily gets jealous over people his age or slightly older that are achieving what he wants.

Tadashi was created when he became part of the theater club. He created this perfect persona that could get along and be liked and admired by everyone, using it whenever he's outside, no matter the circumstance or place.

## Skills
Sewing, clothing designing, persuasion, reading the mood. He speaks fluent Japanese and whatever Engrish learned at school.

## Hobbies
Clothing designing, window shopping, social media, going out.

## Likes
 Fashion, clothes, stars, sunsets, the beach, planetariums, pretty things, and swings.

## Dislikes
Dark colors, family, fatty foods, anything horror, tomboys, cold weather.

## Platonic Relationships
Tadatsugu's relationship with his family is tense. Since he was a child, his parents encouraged technical and scientific interests and strongly rejected creative expression. Himeko, the older sister, fulfilled this expectation while Tadashi never bowed down. Both his talents and skills are traditionally artistic. This has earned his parents disapproval and strained their relationship. Currently, they are largely absent due to work. The Hikage family employs a housemaid who makes meal for the children and upkeeps the place.

While [[Himeko]] has taken upon herself to support her little brother, he believes she's nice to him out of pity. Himeko cooks for them when the housemaid is off (she's not very good), makes an effort to know about his life, and emotionally supports him. This closeness makes her at the receiving of Tadatsugu's childish wrath, from being told to get a boyfriend to listening to his cynical assumptions of her and their parents.
Despite this, Tadatsugu depends on her when he needs support. He appreciates his sister's presence before going to square one in their next interaction. He also helps her with social studies and gives her advice on fashion and relationships. 

[[Dashi]] is a goldfish Tadatsugu received at a festival when he was a child. He became enamored with the little creature and made his parents buy a nice tank for her. He read a lot of books about caring for fish and goldfish. From how to keep a fish tank to a goldfish's physiology and psychology, his early interactions with Dashi were an immediate reflection of his learning. For example, he was for a short time obsessed with decorating the tank with little knickknacks, grass, and rocks for the goldfish to play or hide. The goldfish also influenced his nickname; they should share a kanji or reading. On the topic of names, Dashi is a type of soup broth made with fish stock. Tadatsugu takes great care of Dashi's fish tank but he tends to slip when he's not feeling well emotionally. Dashi is the witness of Tadatsugu's rambles and insecurities. As a other-than-human party, she is privy of the boy's most intimate thoughts, concerns, and feelings than anyone else.

Last but not least, Tadatsugu's relationship with [[Ryuugamine Kiyoshi|Kiyoshi]] has rocky history. From his failed attempt at striking a friendship, their second year of middle school gave them the opportunity to bond. Tadashi, still feeling awkward about their last interaction, offered the boy to model his creation at a competition. Kiyoshi was bashful about responding and Tadashi, noticing he was insecure but willing, gave him leeway into accepting. This kickoffed a long-lasting friendship.

## Occupation
During middle school and high school, after giving up on being a model, Tadashi dedicates himself wholeheartedly to the Fashion Club. The club in his middle school encourages personal projects and participating in competitions.

In college, he majors is Fashion & Clothing Design. Here he meets [[Arisugawa Chika]]. The two form a deep friendship and become each others confidantes on personal and emotional troubles.
