# + Start Here

Welcome to the homepage of the digital garden for the creative fiction project, [[Ta-Dashi (Tentative)]]. This is the final project for the 2024 Honors experiential activity, Honoring the Ocean.

There isn't much to see here for now. Go to [[Characters]] to learn about the actors in this story or to [[Ta-Dashi (Tentative)]] for a mini-essay/pitch.
