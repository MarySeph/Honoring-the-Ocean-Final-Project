Creative writing is a multi-faceted tool to express a myriad of messages. The intention of this story is to frame the ocean, through the goldfish [[Dashi]], ~~a type of Japanese cooking ingredient~~, and a young man named [[Hikage Tadatsugu|Tadashi]]. Goldfishes, when properly cared for, can live for about two decades. Dashi, being Tadashi's beloved companion, receives the care to bear witness Tadashi grow from a child to adulthood.

Their deep connection is reflected in their names. Most notably in the state of Dashii's home. As a child, Tadashi gave the goldfish a large tank with a filter and filled it with little knickknacks for the goldfish to play with or hide. They were inseparable. Thus, when the filter fails and algae overtakes the tank, Tadashi is struggling with fitting in during middle school to notice. And so on and so forth, every time Tadashi doesn't take care of his needs, physical, emotional, psychological, etc, Dashii also suffers.

The metaphor is straightforward. The well-being of the ocean is dependent on ours and vice versa. By not taking care of ourselves, by not *caring,* we are harming both ourselves and other living beings. This story needn't a tragic end with Dashii dying due to Tadashi's negligence. Instead, it ought to with Tadashi realizing the constant struggle he and Dashii must go through to live, that the weight of his life is something he must bear because another life is connected to him. Negligence is bound to happen from time to time and it is the act of nurturing that soothes their maladies. Like Robin Wall-Kimmerer says in her seminal work, Braiding Sweetgrass, "all flourishing is mutual."

When Tadashi placed me in the aquarium, I was overjoyed. The barren place started to have other things like places to hide and things to push. His body was small and his face distorted as if hitting something invisible. Later I understood that wall was there to separate us.

Tadashii was a kind boy. His face beaming whenever he entered the room. After I grew some more, I went by "Dashii." Tadashi was happy when we played hide and seek.

When Tadashi entered the room, he usually wore colorful clothing. Eventually, his attire changed to a stuff collar and the red bag pack to a case. He looked elegant and proper.
