# About this Project

This project was informed by three ideas: *the power of narratives as a tool for connection*, *the creative potential of eco-fiction for crafting narratives about humanity and the natural world which need not exclude current scientific discourse nor scientific agreements*, and *the various emerging story-telling mediums in which these stories can be told*.

More than anything, I believe that to make people care about the ocean and its health, warm and hopeful narrative are essential. Stories, from fiction and non-fiction have the power to unite people across any barrier. Stories, by their very nature seek to make people *care.* Care about the characters, the story, or the ideas being posed.

Through this course, I have had the pleasure to listen to peoples the stories of the ocean. Population density in coastal areas is high in the state of Florida, so I'm not surprised that almost everyone had a childhood story of their time at the ocean. From family vacations to small, almost insignificant moments, those experiences have become part of them. The ocean is a precious place. Those experiences are so personal and intimate that reality does not do it justice. But stories can. They do. I'm sure if I were to ask around, I would get a million different stories whether I ask "what is your connection with the ocean?" or "what is your earliest memory of the beach?" All these stories are connected by a physical place, the ocean and the beach. And guess what? The ocean is truly one. The ocean connects all landforms. I believe it also has the power to connect human hearts. If something so precious to people is threatened, I'm sure that with the right message, people can get together to protect it. 

Inspired by these stories, I tried to write something of my own. Frankly, I don't have the skills to make it a reality at the moment. After all, it's at least a short videogame. Nevertheless, I didn't want to discourage myself but most importantly, rough ideas just didn't do it justice. Even though I wanted to walk the walk and not just talk the talk, for some reason or another, creative writing felt intimidating. Perhaps it is perfectionism. It is something that I have to face soon, if I want to write for the rest of my life.

Thus, I present to you the actual product, [[IDK]]
