# Dashi

## Relationships
- [[Hikage Tadatsugu]]
- [[Hikage Himeko | Himeko]]

## Backstory
Dashi's relationship with Tadatsugu began when both were little. The latter brought her home from a summer festival. Her home got upgraded to a large tank which swiftly became adorned with toys and hideouts.

While she can't communicate with humans through speech, her non-verbal language speaks volumes to those that care. She appreciates Tadatsugu's efforts to give her a comfortable home and forged an emotional attachment with him. The time they spent in their youth is priceless to her. She knows how kind and caring Tadatsugu was, and is sympathetic to his struggles as his relationship with his parents begins to sour. The time Tadatsugu spent talking to Dashi about his day at school became rants about everything that pissed him off about his parents, classmates, and life. Her tank, pushed against the wall, is located in between the bed and door, giving her a full view of the room. Oh, the stories she could tell and the wisdom she would share about life and the human condition if humans could understand her. . . specially as she grows older. Truly a wise old woman in the form of a goldfish.

## Personality
