What theory of well-being do I want this story to be based in? Here are the contenders (based on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry on Well-being):

- Hedonism
	- balance of pleasure and pain.
- Desire-Fulfillment
	- obtaining what one wants.
	- many sub-theories
- Objective List
	- things that are believed to be good for everyone.
	- eg. Knowledge, Education, Autonomy, Freedom, Access to quality food, etc
	- every list is different
	- not concerned with the pain and pleasure they cause in people

So, how to find which fits this story best? Let's ramble.

The exact words to expand on are "interdepence of the health of humanity and marine life." I'm talking about *flourishing.* So yes, well-being.

Looking back to [[Ta-Dashi (Tentative)]], I wrote this, "By not taking care of ourselves, by not *caring,* we are harming both ourselves and other living beings." What's the harm being done here? What I have in mind are the consequences of neglect. Specifically, physical neglect. This is where the state of Dashi's tank is relevant. The neglect is *visible.* It is the material form of emotional suffering.

Care and love are important topics that need to be addressed. Fulfilling the responsibilities one owes to themselves: satisfying hunger, maintaining hygiene, these are acts of self-care. Acts to love. When it comes to pets, owners have the responsibility of making sure their needs are fulfilled. It's not all physical though. Emotional care is also important. One example is to acknowledge their existence. It's why [[Hikage Tadatsugu|Tadashi]] should talk to [[Dashi]], not just feed her and maintain her home.

The specific theory of well-being could be either Hedonism or Desire-Fulfillment. It depends on why Tadashi is unwell. Wait, I'm missing something important. There is a strong psychological component. Both psychological and physiological theories of happiness apply here. Nevertheless, both need to answer the question, **"why is Tadatsugu unhappy?"** Answering such a question in the form of a story would make it a character study. The focus is not that.
